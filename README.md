### Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to me README, I am Cr4yzE. 

I am from Ruhr Uni Bochum, Germany studying BSc mechanical engineering.

Right now I am working for the institute of materials and I am developing algorithms and A.I.'s to help us establish a deeper understanding of materials science.
While i am interested in building apps for people to use, i am trying my best to combine those apps with aesthetically pleasing visuals.

Occasionally i am looking for other ways to use A.I., from gaming to sports.

Skills: UX/UI | Semantic Segmentation | Computer Vision | Python

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about A.I.'s and how to implement them into my every day life, while also deepening my computational analysis skills.
